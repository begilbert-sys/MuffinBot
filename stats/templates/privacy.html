    <h2>Privacy Policy & Opting Out</h2>

    <h3>
        Introduction 
    </h3>
    <p>
        The privacy policy outlines exactly what data is collected, and how you can view, manage, or delete it. 

        If you're in a server running this bot, the stats pages are the <b>only</b> place your data will ever be used. <b>Your data 
        will never be shared with any third-party, ever.</b>
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>
        How is my data kept safe?
    </h3>
    <p>
        To see statistics for a server, your account must be in that server. This information is verified when you login using your Discord account.
        Unfortunately, this means that if you leave a server, its statistics will be hidden from you. 
        <br>
        Because Discord users are prone to leaving and rejoining servers, your data will <b>not</b> be deleted if you leave a server. If you want to delete it, 
        you may do so via the dashboard for that server. 

        <br>
        <br>
        The data itself is securely hosted in an Amazon RDS database. 
    </p>
    <h3>
        What data is collected? 
    </h3>
    <p>
        Here's a list of all data retained by the bot. For servers without the 'server history' feature enabled,
        this only applies to messages sent <i>after</i> the bot joined.
        <h4>Data collected per server</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Server Name</li>
            <li>Server ID</li>
            <li>Server Icon URL</li>
            <li>Names of viewable text channels</li>
            <li>IDs of viewavle text channels</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Data collected per user</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Tag (your username)</li>
            <li>User ID</li>
            <li>Avatar URL</li>
            <li>Number of messages per viewable text channel</li>
            <li>Average message length</li>
            <li>Curse word frequency - curse words themselves are <b>not</b> collected</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Data collected per user message</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>"Uncommon" words - words that do not appear in a standard dictionary</li>
            <li>Users mentioned</li>
            <li>Message date and hour</li>
            <li>URLs used</li>
            <li>Emojis used</li>
            <li>Reactions</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>
        Opting Out - Hiding or Deleting Your Data
    </h3>
    <p>
        If you aren't comfortable with the bot displaying or retaining your data, you can manage
        the data associated with your account using a few simple commands.
    </p>
        <h4>Hiding your data</h4>
    <p>
        Using this command means that any mentions of your account in the server's stats will be hidden. 
        However, your data will still anonymously count towards server-wide statistics. 
        This action <b>can</b> be undone. All of your data will be retained, but not shown.
    </p>
        <h4>Deleting your data</h4>
    <p>
        Using this command deletes your data. This action <b>cannot be undone!</b> All data associated 
        with your account will be permanently erased. The bot will subsequently ignore all activity associated with your account. 
    </p>
        <h4>What if my account is no longer in the server?</h4>
    <p>
        The opt-out commands may still be used if you DM the bot.
    </p>
        <h4>What if I deleted my account?</h4>
    <p>
        Unfortunately, Discord does not alert bots when accounts are deleted. 
        If your account's data was collected before your account's deletion, and you want it erased, 
        you will have to send an email to [email here] containing the following data: 
        After some time, your data will be manually deleted and a confirmation email will be sent in reply.
