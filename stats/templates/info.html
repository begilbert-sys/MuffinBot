        <p>
            MuffinStats is heavily influenced by <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/mircstats/index.html">mIRCStats</a>, a program that served the same purpose for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat">IRC</a> chatrooms back in the day.
            As for development, MuffinStats is written mostly in Python, with indespensible help from the following third-party tools:
            <ul style="margin-left: 50px;">
                <li><a href="https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">discord.py</a> - a library for handling interaction with Discord's API</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> - a framework for database and website management</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
            <p>Both of these resources have beautifully-written documentation and made the development of this project much easier.</p>
            <p>Aside from that, MuffinStats is created and maintained solely by @muffinlicious on Discord.</p>

        <p>
            The project is still in beta, so expect things to occasionally go wrong. If you encounter any bugs, or want to suggest an idea, please DM me on Discord (@muffinlicious), or email me at <a href="mailto:muffinstats@gmail.com" target="_blank">muffinstats@gmail.com</a>. Any help is greatly appreciated!
